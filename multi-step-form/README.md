## Project Purpose:
Alright, so what's the deal with "Multi Step Form"? Well, think of those super long, tedious forms you hate filling out. We took that pain away! This project breaks down a mammoth form into easy-peasy sections: personal stuff, choosing your plan, some optional goodies, and a quick recap. Developed with Next.js 13, it's a sweet example of making user experiences smoother. In short, we're making forms less yawn-worthy and more "heck, that was quick!"
