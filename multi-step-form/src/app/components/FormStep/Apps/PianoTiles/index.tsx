            You open Piano Tiles, your screen turning into a sleek, black-and-white keyboard awaiting your touch. As the first notes of a classical melody scroll down, you tap rapidly, each tile playing a note, creating a flow of music under your fingers. Your focus sharpens, the tiles speed up, challenging your reflexes and timing, as you strive to keep the melody flowing without missing a beat.
