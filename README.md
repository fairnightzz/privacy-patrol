# Setup

Make sure to install nvmrc. This means going to 
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script

Make sure to refresh your terminal.

After setup, call `nvm use`. If this doesn't work you need to call nvm install.

```bash
cd multi-step-form
npm install
npm run dev
```
